# [easy] random_lottery
### Exploit challenge

#### Task message
Work hard, win hard and spend hard.

And don't be afraid of threads :)

#### Hints
1. I have negative feelings about `abs` function...
2. hm... how `abs` will work with `INT_MAX` or something like that (remember that int64_t has 64 bits).

#### Stats
Number of solves at the event: 0

#### Note
Task was (probably) unsolvable during the CTF. This is fixed version.
