### monty python

correct PIN: 566075152

We can either rewrite binary to C (or another) language and bruteforce (python and other slow languages are not recommended for such tasks ;) ) or reverse the algorithm.

The algo is simple for loop with 22 iterations. Inside there is just and operator and bit shift. Knowing the correct pass ("and saint attila...") we can compute the PIN byte-by-byte.
